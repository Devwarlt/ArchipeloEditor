# ArchipeloEditor
Editor for various things related to Archipelo. This tool is designed for the developers of Archipelo to make it easier for us to work on maps, entity types, tile, elements and more, all related to Archipelo.

Currently it does not work with the new Archipelo. Here is what we have planned for the editor:
- Code cleanup (Code is fairly ugly right now)
- Compatibility with the new Archipelo
- Tile/Element editor
- Entity type editor

Features planned for the map editor specifically:
- Blending tool (Automatically places borders between tiles to "blend" them. Ex: grass and sand)
- Entity tool (Allows for adding entities)
- Much more
